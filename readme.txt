1) For the simulation of Bayesian nets, go fire up samiam.jar first.
2) Import the simulate.net file.
3) Go to query mode.
4) Select all nodes by dragging a box around them, or manually selecting them one by one (ctrl pressed)
5) Go to view and check select bars/windows for each node. Now you can see the probablities given the current values of all nodes.
6) To push evidence in the system, force click on bars to set as T/F - notice change in other nodes' probablities.
